# Your Name
---

Hi, my name is Samarth Dev. I'm currently a senior at Arizona State University ðŸ”± part of the Class of 2024, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I've worked on multiple open-source projects and led many organizations, most noteably DEVim and Otta United (formerly known as Bayreach).

Aside from advising different organizations in education, I also have a blog on different computer science topics for people to enjoy, as well as quick titbits on the little things I learn. I hope you will find this helpful to improve your academic and/or corporate careers.

But a technical discpline isn't the only thing I'm interested in, I've also led and studied multiple marketing directives from various companies. All of which will be discussed and debated over at my blog.

p.s. I'm also a huge unix and neovim enthusiast (if you can't already tell) and will be covering and testing a bunch of linux distros and linux development
