Hi, my name is Samarth Dev. I'm currently a senior at Arizona State University ðŸ”±, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics of the Class of 2024. I've worked on multiple open-source projects, most noteably DEVim and Otta United (formerly known as Bayreach).

Over the years, I've created and advised different organizations in education, I also have a blog on different computer science topics for people to enjoy, as well as quick titbits on the little things I learn. I hope you will find this helpful to improve your academic and/or corporate careers.

Aside from building new tools and organizations, I've also advised and led multiple marketing directives. All of which will be discussed and debated over at my blog.

p.s. I'm also a huge unix and neovim enthusiast (if you can't already tell) and will be covering and testing a bunch of linux distros and linux development
